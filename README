Boost::Python currently seems to be the most advanced
and easiest method to use C++ together with Python.
However, it takes some time to set everything up using
autotools instead of boost-build, so I've published my template here.

To build the initial example, run ./initialize.sh.
For most subsequent modifications, autoreconf && ./configure
should suffice.

This is based on Philipp Sterne's work here:
